# cpp-eleven

This project is a collection of small beautiful things that can be done
with c++ and some beautiful new features that std=c++11 (++) brings us.

### Building and Running

Well this project does't do anything much just dummy codes.
But if you want to run it (depending on your OS) you can do:

######mac/linux

```
c++ -std=c++11 -stdlib=libc++ something.cpp Class.cpp -o executable
```
